# `rromeo` – an R interface for SHERPA/RoMEO API

`rromeo` is an R client for the [SHERPA/RoMEO API](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/index.php?la=en&fIDnum=&mode=simple). SHERPA/RoMEO is a database that gives information on editorial policies of scientific journals regarding the archival of preprint, postprint and publishers' manuscripts. `rromeo` is aimed at scientists interested in archival practices of scientific journals, such as professionals of [scientometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientometrics) but also at scientist of specific fields interested in the practices of their fields.

## Install

The latest stable release of `rromeo` is available on CRAN and can be installed
with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rromeo")
```

You can also install the development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ropensci/rromeo")
```

## API Key

Note that SHERPA/RoMEO lets you run 500 requests per day per IP address, by [registering for a free API key](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/apiregistry.php) you can bypass this limit.

`rromeo` can use your registered SHERPA/RoMEO API key; you can either pass it as a string when querying the data with the argument `key`:

``` r
rr_journal_name("Journal of Geology", key = "Iq83AIL5bss")
```

or you can specify the environment variable `SHERPAROMEO_KEY` in an `.Rprofile` or in an `.Renviron` file and `rromeo` will automatically retrieve the API key.
See the [specific vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/rromeo/articles/setting_up_api_key.html) to know how to apply and use the API key with `rromeo`.

## Usage

`rromeo` contains functions to retrieve data from the SHERPA/RoMEO API (for a complete overview please refer to the [vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/rromeo/articles/rromeo.html)). The data is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 (CC BY-NC-SA 2.5) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/). A suggestion of citation is included in `rromeo` via `citation("rromeo")`.

`rromeo` functions are prefixed with `rr_` such as `rr_journal_name()` that lets you retrieve a journal policy information using the title of a journal:

```{r example_rr_journal_name}
rromeo::rr_journal_name("Journal of Biogeography", qtype = "exact")
```

the `qtype` argument indicates the type of query to make (`exact` for exact matching of the title, `contains` for partial matching and `starts with` to match only the beginning of the title).

You can also retrieve a journal information using its ISSN:

```{r example_rr_journal_issn}
rromeo::rr_journal_issn("0305-0270")
```

`rromeo` also provides a function to retrieve information based on publisher ID `rr_publisher()`.

SHERPA/RoMEO provides a synthetic "colour" for each journal, the colour summarizes the editorial policy of a journal:

  | RoMEO colour | Archiving policy                                        |
  |:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------|
  | `green`      | can archive preprint, postprint and publisher's version |
  | `blue`       | can archive postprint **or** publisher's version        |
  | `yellow`     | can archive preprint                                    |
  | `white`      | archiving not formally supported                        |
  
(Table taken from <http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/definitions.php#colours>)

`rromeo` lets you retrieve the policies of all journals of a given colour using the function `rr_romeo_colour()` (**NOTE:** this function can be slow as there are many journals to retrieve):

```{r example_rr_romeo_colour}
green_journals = rromeo::rr_romeo_colour("green")
green_journals[8:12,]
```
